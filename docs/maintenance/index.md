The Hummingbot Foundation’s primary role is to coordinate the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the open source Hummingbot codebase via a decentralized set of actors: Sponsors, Contributors, Maintainers, and Users.

![](/assets/img/foundation-flywheel.webp)

* **Sponsors** are crypto exchanges, blockchain protocols, or trading firms who fund bounties to build and maintain Hummingbot components, such as connectors or strategies. Usage of these components benefit sponsors by increasing user adoption, activity, and transaction volume on their respective exchanges and blockchains.

* **Contributors** and **Maintainers** are individual developers and firms that build Hummingbot components and submit their work as pull requests to the official Github repository. Maintainers, who typically start as contributors, have ongoing responsibilities to maintain the components they build, either for free or for ongoing support fees.

* **Users** are individual and professional traders who install and use the Hummingbot open source software to run trading bots with their own capital. In the Hummingbot configuration, they may elect to report their aggregated, anonymized exchange-level trading volume, which the Foundation may publish.

## Monthly reporting

To give the Hummingbot community transparency into the operations of the Hummingbot Foundation, the Foundation will publish a monthly report that lists the sources and uses of funds, starting in February 2021.

See [Monthly Reports](reports) for more information.

## Connector maintenance agreements

Hummingbot [exchange connectors](/exchanges) integrate with the API of a cryptocurrency exchange in order to expose standardized data format and endpoints to Hummingbot strategies (automated processes that interact with exchange APIs) that are created and configured by Users. Since exchange APIs vary widely, these connectors allow anyone to run bots across multiple exchanges without requiring engineering time on low-level exchange API integrations.

See [Agreements](agreements) for an active list of agreements.

## Bounties, grants, and hackathons

The Foundation’s also work with Sponsors seeking to fund specific work items such as new connectors, new strategies, or enhancements or fixes to existing components (bounties), as well as others who want to fund more work in more general areas such as strategies for new assets or exchange types (grants and hackathons).

The Foundation will charge Sponsors a fee in order to administer the program and coordinate with developers, and to faciliate the review/merge of the resulting development work.
